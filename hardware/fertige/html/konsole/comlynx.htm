<H1>How does the ComLynx port on the Jaguar work?</H1>
<HR>
<P>The Jaguar does not have a ComLynx port per se, but has a ComLynx signal
   on the system bus.  An expansion port add-on would make the port
   available, and developers had announced plans for such accessories.  It is possible to daisy-chain multiple Jaguars for multiplayer
   games into a "Jaguar network".  In theory, it'd also be possible to connect
   Jaguars and Lynxes, though no plans for cross-system software are currently
   in the works.</P>
 
   <P>There is also talk that the Jaguar's ComLynx signal can allow Lynxes to be
   used as peripherals: software can be developed to allow Lynxes to be part
   of a Jaguar game as "smart" controllers.</P>

   <P>A number of networking peripherals for the Jaguar are available.</P>
