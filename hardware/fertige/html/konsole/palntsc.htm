<H1>PAL and NTSC Jaguars</H1>
<HR>
<P>There is no difference in the Jaguar game software.  A properly-written
   Jaguar game detects PAL or NTSC at startup and changes the playfield size
   and game speeds accordingly.  A properly-written Jaguar game will run at
   the same speed on either machine.  There are no regional or national
   market lock-outs as there are for other game consoles.</P>

   <P>The Jaguar consoles themselves are configured differently, according to the
   country they are sold in.  The primary differences are in the video output
   format (NTSC or PAL) and the power adapters (110 volt or 220 volt).  For
   example, to use an American-market Jaguar in Europe, you need a 220
   volt power adapter (e.g. Sega Genesis/Mega Drive Adaptor) and a SCART television set to
   accept the Jaguar's RGB signals.  Some European TV sets may also require
   changing the Jaguar display from a 60Hz frame rate to 50Hz.</P>
