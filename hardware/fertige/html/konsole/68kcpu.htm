<H1>The Jaguar uses a 68000.  Isn't that the CPU?</H1>
<HR>
<P>Quoting from Jaguar designer John Mathieson, "<I>It may be the CPU in
   the sense that it's the centre of operation, and boot-straps the machine,
   and starts everything else going; however, it is not the centre of Jaguar's
   power. ... The 68000 is like a manager who does no real work, but tells
   everybody else what to do.</I>"</P>

   <P>And...</P>

   <P>"<I>Atari were keen to use a 68K family device, and we looked closely at
   various members.  We did actually build a couple of 68030 versions of the
   early beta developers systems, and for a while were going to use a 68020.
   However, this turned out too expensive.  We also considered the possibility
   of no [Motorola 680x0 chip] at all.  I always felt it was important to have
   some normal processor, to give developers a warm feeling when they start.
   The 68K is inexpensive and does that job well.  I maintain that it's only
   there to read the joysticks.</I>"</P>
