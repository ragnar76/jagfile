<P> The Jaguar has five processors, which are contained in three chips.  Two of
  the chips are proprietary designs, nicknamed "Tom" and "Jerry".  The third
  chip is a standard <A HREF="./68kcpu.htm">Motorola 68000</A> used as a coprocessor.  Tom and Jerry are
  built using an 0.5 micron silicon process.  With proper programming, all
  five processors can run in parallel.</P>
<P>
<P>The Jaguar uses 24-bit addressing, and is reportedly capable of accessing
   data as follows:</P>
<P>
           <UL><LI>Six megabytes cartridge ROM
<LI>           Eight megabytes DRAM
<LI>           Two megabytes miscellaneous/expansion</UL>
<P>
   <P>All of the processors can access the main DRAM memory area directly.  The
   Digital Signal Processor and the Graphics Processor can execute code out of
   either their internal caches, or out of main memory.  The only limitations
   are that</P>
<P>
   <OL ><LI> "jump" instructions in main memory have certain restrictions; the JMP
          (unconditional jump) command is longword-aligned, while the JR
          (jump-indexed-by-register) command must be either word- or longword-
        aligned.  And
<LI>    running out of the cache is much faster (up to four times faster) and
          efficient.</OL>

   <P>Some believe that the inability to jump/branch in main memory makes the
   main memory feature useless.</P>

   <P>Swapping data between the caches and the main memory is a quick, low
   overhead operation, and therefore the main memory is often used as "swap
   space" for cache code.  The RISC compiler now included in the Jaguar
   developer's kit produces code that transparently swaps code through the
   cache.  This effectively lets developers write RISC code without concern
   for the cache size limits.</P>

   <P>Compressed cartridge data can be uncompressed in real-time, and ratios of
   up to 14:1 have been cited.  In theory, a Jaguar cartridge can store up to
   84 megabytes (672 megabits) of data, though actual results will vary
   widely (most often, images are compressed, while sound and code are not).
   Compression is performed with BPEG, an enhanced JPEG image decompression
   mechanism.  BPEG supercedes the former JagPEG algorithm, working up to 10
   times faster and with more flexibility.</P>

   <H4>Other Jaguar features:</H4>
<UL>
  <LI>Support for <A HREF="./comlynx.htm">ComLynx</A> I/O for communications with the Atari Lynx hand-held
       game system and networked multiconsole games (on DSP port, accessible
       by optional add-on connector).  Networking of up to 32 Jaguar units
       available.

  <LI>The two controller ports can be expanded to support "dozens" of
     controllers

    <LI>Digital and analog interfaces; 
    Keyboards, mice, and light guns are possible

  <LI>Expansion port allows connection to cable TV and other networks
  <LI>Digital Signal Processor port allows connection to modems and digital
     audio peripherals (such as DAT players)
  <LI>One megabyte per second serial interface
  <LI>9600 baud, RS-232 serial port (accessible with optional interface)
  <LI>General-purpose I/O bits via the cartridge port
  <LI>Can accomodate future expansions of different processor types, I/O types,
       video types, and memory types and/or quantities.
</UL>

<P>The Jaguar is capable of doing the following visual effects:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>High-speed scrolling (Object Processor).
  <LI>Texture mapping on two- and three-dimensional objects (GPU and Blitter).
  <LI>Morphing one object into another object (GPU).
  <LI>Scaling, rotation, distortion, and skewing of sprites and images
       (Object Processor).
  <LI>Lighting and shading from single and multiple light sources (GPU and
       Blitter).
  <LI>Transparency (Object Processor).
  <LI>"Rendering" up to 850 million one-bit pixels/second (35 million 24-bit
       pixels/second, 26 million 32-bit pixels/second), or 50 million Goroud
       shaded pixels/second.  "Rendering" is believed to mean transferring a
       pixel from a frame buffer to the screen.
  <LI>Sprites of "unlimited" size and quantity.  Realistically, sprites can be
       over 1,000 pixels wide/tall, and the number of sprites allowed is
       limited by processor cycles instead of a fixed value in hardware
       (Object processor).
  <LI>Programmable screen resolutions, from 160 to 800 pixels per line.  The
       resolution can be increased even further with additional hardware up to
       a reported 1350 pixels per line.
</UL>
<P>
<P>One of the Jaguar modes is called "CRY mode", which supports lighting and
effects in 3D graphics.  Red, green, and blue color elements are ranged
from 0 to 255, and the lighting level for any pixel can be changed by
setting one byte linearly.  E.g., the relative proportions of red, blue,
and green are indicated with one byte, while a second byte selects an
overall intensity of 0 to 255.  CRY allows much smoother shading of single
colors, but doesn't allow blending between colors as smoothly.</P>

<P>Actual graphics performance is hard to measure, as there are no industry-
standard benchmarks.  Rebellion Software has claimed that the Jaguar can
render <I>"10,000 Gourard shaded, large, 65536 color, any shape polygons per
second, while still performing other tasks"</I>.  Presumably this level can
be increased further with optimized programming.</P>
