<H1>JOHN MATHIESON INTERVIEW</H1>
<HR>

  <P>INTERVIEW BY: Travis Guy (Atari Explorer Online, jaunary 1995)</P>

  <P>Known world-wide as the "father of the jaguar", John Mathieson is seen by many as Atari's 35 year old   savior.</P>
  <P>Born and raised in Scotland, Mathieson obtained his education at Fettes in Edinburgh, then at Cambridge
  University.  He currently holds a master's degree in engineering and in computer science, as well as the    title
  of Vice-President of Advanced Technology at Atari Corp.</P>
      <P>Over this past weekend, 1 was able to participate in a special treat.AEO was given permission to conduct
  an interview with Mr. Mathieson, who graciously gave up some of his free time to answer aff questions.
  (Finishing up I might add, during the San Francisco/Dallas NFC Championship game on Sunday, his first view-
  ing of an American football game.)</P>
<HR>

<P><B>Travis Guy:</B> What were your interests/bobbies
  while growing up?</P>
  <P><B>John Mathieson:</B> Electricity generally, and stereo sys-
  tems. I owned and ran my own mobile disco system
  while a student. I still have parts of it, but it doesn't
  tun so well on 110 V!</P>
  <P><B>TG:</B> <Grin> You're an engineer, can't you design a
  converter?
  </P><P><B>JM:</B> I just hate compatibility problems!
  <P><B>TG:</B> To whom did you look up to as a cbild?
  </P><P><B>JM:</B> I can't put my finger on anyone in particular.  I
  always wanted to become a millionaire before I was
  30 (now put back to 40).
  <P><B>TG:</B> Are you a video gamer?  What's your favorite
  game?
  </P><P><B>JM:</B> Well, sort of.  I spent a lot of time on Sinclair
  Spectrum games, Manic Miner being my favourite.
  In recent years I have enjoyed Doom and
  Cybermorph particularly.
  <P><B>TG:</B> How did you get into tbe silicon industry?
  </P><P><B>JM:</B> When I left university, I was offered a job by
  Clive Sinclair, at Sinclair Research.  At that time
  Sinclair was about to launch the Spectrum (a very
  cheap Z80 based home computer), which dominated the UK home computer industry for a few years
  in the early 80s.  My first job was to sit and write
  BASIC programs to find bugs in the BASIC interpreter and this led into writing the demo program
  used at the launch, and doing technical support to
  the marketing and PR people.  From there I moved into doing real engineering.
  <P><B>TG:</B>, What other past hardware design projects
  have you been involved in?
  </P><P><B>JM:</B> At Sinclair, I did a lot of cost reduction work on
  the Spectrum, and
  then moved into peripheral design work on the QL
  (an early 68000 based machine).  I was lead hard-
  ware engineer on a project called Pandora, which
  was a portable machine based on the Spectrum
  architecture, and which used the Sinclair flat CRT
  plus some optics as a display. lt was never manufac-
  tured.
  <P><B>TG:</B> How did you come to work for atari?
  </P><P><B>JM:</B> Sinclair folded in 1986, and the name was
  bought by Amstrad.  With two other colleagues,
  Martin Brennan and Ben Cheese, I started a compa-
  ny called Flare to design a revolutionary games
  computer (from an idea that floated around in
  Sinclair called Loki), which we dubbed Flare One.
  This had a fast Z80, plus a decent video controller, a
  Blitter, and a simple DSP. We targeted the Amiga, and
  this system was designed to be faster and a lot
  cheaper.We funded this doing design consultancy
  work.  The Flare One system never made it as a
  games machine-we sold a lot of chip-sets to a com-
  pany who made video quiz machines for UK pubs;
  and we also licensed it to a Welsh company who
  intended to sell it as a games machine called the
  Konix Multi System.This never happened, sadly. (Jeff
  Minter actually wrote a game for it!)<BR>

 Having done Flare One, we knew how we
 would do it better next time, using a few year's
 advance of technology, plus all the experience we
 gained.We also realised that we needed the backing
 of a larger company to fund the development.At this
 point, Martin Brennan was doing the design work
 on the main Panther chip as a piece of consultancy
 for Atari, so we presented our ideas to Atari in late
 1989.  We set up a new company called Flare 2,
 which Atari owned 80% of, and set out to design
 jaguar.At this point, Ben Cheese left us
 (he went on to design the Nintendo Super FX chip),
 so Martin Brennan and myself were the design team.
 Martin designed the jaguar video system (which is
 loosely based on Panther), and the memory con-
 troller. I designed the RISC processors and Blitter.<BR>
     In late 1993, having finished jaguar, Martin
 decided to move on to something else, so I proposed to Atari (on the morning after the jaguar
 launch), that I move to the USA to continue work on
 jaguar technology. I moved here in january 1994.
 <P><B>TG:</B> Did you have anything to do with the design
 of the Panther?
 </P><P><B>JM:</B> Martin was employed as a contractor by Atari in
 late 1989 to work on Panther.  He made a lot of
 improvements to the concept, which already existed when he started.  We (Flare) took it through to
 working developers systems.
 <P><B>TG:</B> Do you know what prompted the jumping
 from the Panther to the jaguar project?
 </P><P><B>JM:</B> I think it became clear to Atari that jaguar would
 be launched one to two years after Panther, and this
 made no commercial sense. Jaguar was well
 advanced in design at the point Panther was cancelled, and it was clear that it would be a far, far bet-
 ter machine.
 <P><B>TG:</B> Is there any Panther bardware in existence?
 <grin>
 </P><P><B>JM:</B> I think there is still a pile of developers systems
 in the office.  Make us an offer. <bigger grin>
 <P><B>TG:</B> Can you tell us a little bit more about Martin,
 and about any of your other colleagues that
 assisted in the design/development of jaguar?
 </P><P><B>JM:</B> Martin, like me, is a Scot and a Cambridge graduate.  Most of the best engineers in the world are
 Scottish. (Beam me up .... ) Martin and I did all the
 work on the chip-set, but honorable mentions
 should also go to Richard Miller at Atari who was



 our engineering contact (who is also ex-Sinclair
 (and has now left Atari, and Tim Dunn who worked
 at Flare and is now in Sunnyvale at Atari (and is also
 ex-Sinclair), who did a lot of the PCB development
 work, and the design of the developers systems
 around the jaguar core.
 <P><B>TG:</B> Are you currently involved in the design,
 planning, consulting or overseeing of Jaguar
 peripherals?
 </P><P><B>JM:</B> I am involved in the planning, but that is all.
 <P><B>TG:</B> What do you presently do for Atari?
 </P><P><B>JM:</B> I am Vice-President of Advanced Technology.  I
 run a group whose primary responsibility is the
 jaguar ASICS.  We do support and cost-reduction of
 the existing chips, plus the development of future
 versions.
 <P><B>TG:</B> For those readers wbo aren't engineers (like
 me), What is an ASIC, and why does it sound so
 terribly important?
 </P><P><B>JM:</B> It would be perfectly possible to put together a
 machine with the performance of jaguar using chips
 picked out from the catalogs of the major chip ven-
 dors.  Unfortunately, doing it that way would give a
 retail price of a thousand dollars or more.What I do
 is work out the leanest, most efficient way of doing
 the functions we need, and then design the chip-set
 to do it.  By making the hardware do just what is
 needed for games, and no more, there are a lot of
 cost savings to be made.<BR>
     We then put this design into custom chips
 called ASICs (application specific integrated cir-
 cuits, if you really want to know), and it is the two
 jaguar ASICs (Tom and jerry) that make it so special.
 Having done these, they then become unimportant,
 and the games become everything.
 <P><B>TG:</B> How long did it take to develop the jaguar?
 </P><P><B>JM:</B> Three years from start to being production
 ready.
 <P><B>TG:</B> Was there a single guiding principle behind
 the design of the jaguar?
 </P><P><B>JM:</B> Our main aim was to guess what technology
 would be practical when jaguar was in production
 (chip sizes, DRAM architecture, speeds, and so on),
 and to leap-frog the rest of the world.  Compare
 Panther which was more of a "me-too" response to
 the SNES and Genesis.  We took the leap to 64-bit
 DRAM, and very large ASICs and package pin-counts.
      We also set out to make it cheap and very fast!

<P><B>TG:</B>, What was the first "breakthrough" in the
   Jaguar design process?
   </P><P><B>JM:</B> The main one was realising that designing our
   own RISC processors made sense.  By integrating all
   the video animation logic - RISC processor, Blitter,
   and Object Processor - in one chip, performance
   could be higher and cost lower.<BR>
       The CRY colour scheme jaguar uses, which
   allows smooth shading of 16-bit pixels, was also a
   useful discovery.
   <P><B>TG:</B> <Laugb> I would guess that your CRY scheme
   is now patented by Atari!
   </P><P><B>JM:</B> Yes. As you know from the Sega deal,Atari has a
   strong portfolio of patents, and jaguar has added to
   that. (Sega paid Atari $90M because the Genesis
   infringes some key atari patents.)
   <P><B>TG:</B> All other companies are now on official
   notice... <grin> What was the most difficult obstacle to overcome in the Jaguar design process?
   </P><P><B>JM:</B> I think we underestimated the problems that
   would arise because we were pushing the technology envelope.  The first Jaguar silicon, which was
   effectively beta test hardware, proved much harder
   to lay out and get working in simulation than we
   expected.  We believe at the time that it was the
   largest ASIC, apart from test chips, that the major
   japanese silicon vendor we were working with had
   ever done.
   <P><B>TG:</B> The 68000 aside, how were the chips decided
   upon?  How were Tom andjerry arrived at?
   </P><P><B>JM:</B> It's basically a simple division into a video chip
   and an audio chip.The names were arbitrary.
   <P><B>TG:</B> What was the reasoning behind using the
   Motorola 68000 in the Jaguar?  Was it a "last
   minute" decision?
   </P><P><B>JM:</B> We had no strong feelings about an external
   CPU in the early days of thejaguar design.Atari were
   keen to use a 68K family device, and we looked
   closely at various members.We did actually build a
   couple of 68030 versions of the early beta develop-
   ers systems, and for a while were going to use a
   68020.  However, this turned out too expensive.  We
   also considered the possibility of no CPU at all. 1
   always felt it was important to have some normal
   processor, to give developers a warm feeling when
   they start.The 68K is inexpensive and does that job
   weil. I maintain that it's only there to read the joy-
   sticks. (Although Leonard Tramiel now recommends



   that developers do that with the GPU too!)
   <P><B>TG:</B>, What do you say to those outsiders wbo insist
   on calling the jag's 68000, "the CPU of the
   machine" ?
   </P><P><B>JM:</B> Call it what you like.  It may be the CPU in the
   sense that it's the centre of operation, and boot-
   straps the machine, and starts everything else going;
   however, it is not the centre of Jaguar's power.The
   centre of jaguar's wonderful abilities come from the
   two RISC processors for graphics and sound, and
   the two 64-bit animation
   co-processors, the Blitter and Object Processor.  The
   68000 is like a manager who does no real work, but
   teils everybody else what to do.
   <P><B>TG:</B> Here's a fresh question for you, Im sure.
   <grin> Is jaguar really a 64-bit machine?
   </P><P><B>JM:</B> Jaguar has a 64-bit memory interface to get a
   high bandwidth out of cheap DRAM.  We achieve
   over 100 Mbytes/second, which is very respectable,
   and gives the system its speed and flexibility.Where
   the system needs to be 64-bit then it is 64-bit, so the
   Object Processor, which takes data from DRAM and
   builds the display is 64-bit; and the blitter, which
   does all the 3D rendering, screen clearing, and pixel
   shuffling, is 64-bit.  Where the system does not need
   to be 64-bit, it isn't.  There is no point in a 64-bit
   address space in a games console! 3D calculations
   and audio processing do not generally use 64-bit
   numbers, so there would be no advantage to 64-bit
   processors for this.<BR>
      Jaguar has the data shifting power of a 64-bit
   system, which is what matters for games, so can rea-
   sonably be considered a 64-bit system.  But that does-
   n't mean it has to be 64-bit throughout.
   <P><B>TG:</B> What was the rationale for the "small" caches
   on the RISC chips?
   </P><P><B>JM:</B> Well in chip area they are not small at all, but
   huge.
   <P><B>TG:</B> I guess it'd depend on how a programmer
   approaches it, wouldnt it?  People who are used to
   writing tight code don't have any troubles, while
   coders who are used to letting compilers "do the
   hardpart" for them see the RISC caches as tiny.
   </P><P><B>JM:</B> The most vocal criticism of the Jaguar architecture I have heard is from John Carmack, who wrote
   Doom.  A lot of his points are well made; but he
   brought his game from an architecture with lots of
   central processing power, and dreadful graphics rendering speed (the PC).  Doom was therefore a difficult port; as jaguar presents both a very different
  programming model and a much more balanced sys-
  tem.  I don't think many good games writers let com-
  pilers do the hard part-they increasingly let them do
  the easy bits, but I believe most developers still hand
  code the important stuff.<BR>
     Getting the best performance out of Jaguar is
  not simple-and programmers complain about it.  But
  almost all of the developers I spoke to expect to get
  much better performance out of their second gener-
  ation games, as they are now up the learning curve.
  <P><B>TG:</B> What about the jaguar's bardware are you
  most proud of?
  </P><P><B>JM:</B> The RISC processor design.
  <P><B>TG:</B> Can you elaborate, or would that give too
  much away?
  </P><P><B>JM:</B> Well, without giving anything away, the perfor-
  mance worked out better than I had hoped for.A lot
  of the early design decisions turned out to be right
  in ways that may not have been clear at the time.
  There was no single moment of invention, they just
  slowly evolved into something that I am pleased
  with.  Of course, it's not perfect.
  <P><B>TG:</B> You've already indicated that a custom-
  designed RISC processor would be bester suited in
  a fast video game console than a processor taken
  "Off the shelf" Knowing Tom and Jerry as intimately as you do, can you offer us a general comparison between them, and the RISCs used by
  other consoles? (ARM-60, SH-2.)
  </P><P><B>JM:</B> The ARM has a code size problem, as it uses 32-
  bit instruction words, compared to our 16 bits.  It's
  quite an old design now, and it does not achieve the
  same performance we do at the same clock speed.<BR>
  The SH-2 I
  know less about, but it appears to be slower at mul-
  tiplication, which is the key to 3D maths and audio
  synthesis. I know Sega changed both the 32X and
  Saturn from one to two SH-2s to get better perfor-
  mance. (The rumour is this happened after they saw
  Jaguar.)
  <P><B>TG:</B> Is there anything about jaguar that you would
  change if you could hop into a time machine and
  go back?
  </P><P><B>JM:</B> Well, I would of course have to fix all the bugs, and
  do it in half the time as there would be two of me!
  <P><B>TG:</B> How paternalistic are your feelings towards



  Jaguar?  Do you see it as a design, or as some-
  thing more?
  </P><P><B>JM:</B> It's like a child which has grown up and left
  home.  For three years it was ours alone; but at the
  Jaguar launch in New York I suddenly realised that it
  was no longer mine. lt was quite a surprising feeling
  at the time, but now it's just a design.  Now, all I see
  are the day-to-day problems - the production glitches, developers' problems and so on.
  <P><B>TG:</B> You feel that jaguar is the most powerful
  "video game" machine on any market?
  </P><P><B>JM:</B> In the U.S. today, certainly.  World-wide, the
  Saturn and PlayStation are serious opposition.  But in
  terms of entry price, jaguar offers much more bang-per-buck than those machines.
  <P><B>TG:</B> How hard would it be to turn jaguar into a full-
  fledged computer?  Would such a task be feasible?
  </P><P><B>JM:</B> It would be possible.There was a proposal within Atari before the Jaguar launch to do a computer
  version as well, although it never came to anything.
  If it looked like the market was going to go that way,
  then jaguar would make a very nice computer sys-
  tem. lt can drive a VGA monitor with the right soft-
  ware, and just needs a keyboard and a storage
  device.  However, I think the PC has that market sewn
  up, and Atari has no plans to do a Jaguar computer.
  <P><B>TG:</B> Atari bas announced plans for the Jag II in
  their 1993 financial statements.  Do you have any
  input or information you can share concerning
  the development of this new plattorm?  Will it be
  marketed as "Jaguar II"?
  </P><P><B>JM:</B> Jaguar 2 is currently in development, and that is
  my main responsibility.  I cannot discuss technical
  aspects of it, and I don't think anyone knows what
  to call it yet.<BR>
      I spoke to a lot of developers regarding where
  they saw the shortcomings of the current hardware.
  As a result of this, and our own experience, I set out
  with main design aims of better polygon perfor-
  mance, better texture map performance, better
  audio, and compatibility. You will have to wait and
  see how well we do with these aims.
  <P><B>TG:</B> Fair enough.  Were waiting to see.  Jaguar 2
  aside, wbere do you see the video gaming industry
  going, in terms of hardware, in the next few years?
  </P><P><B>JM:</B> It is a technology led industry, so you should look
  to SGI workstations, and state-of-the-art arcade
  machines, to see what will be console priced in a few
years.  It is interesting the way 3D0, Sony and Sega all
 think there is a market at $400.  I believe that the real
 volume remains at a much lower price than that.
 <P><B>TG:</B> "the lower, the better" Right? <grin>
 </P><P><B>JM:</B> Absolutely. I think if you look at Nintendo's pub-
 lic statements on the Ultra 64 (no CD drive, simple
 fast architecture), you will see they think the same.
 The really high sellers, the old Atari games consoles,
 the NES, SNES and Genesis are all around the hun-
 dred dollar mark.
 <P><B>TG:</B> Not a hardware question, but do you think
 that future video game consoles will rely on operating systems?
 </P><P><B>JM:</B> No, not really.There may be some movement to
 standard libraries, but I believe that the best perfor-
 mance will always be had by going straight at the
 hardware.
 <P><B>TG:</B> Ever since the late 70's, video game bardware
 have followed, and sometimes led home computer
 bardware in terms of innovation and perfor-
 mance.  CD-ROMs for storage, and parallel proces-
 sors for computational ability are the current
 rage.  While many companies are seeking to
 increase the amount of data that can be stored on
 CD-ROM, and others are working to develop faster 
processors, What do you see as the next leap in
 innovation in video gaming bardware?
 </P><P><B>JM:</B> Realism and interactivity are what makes these
 machines exciting.  Realism is what we pushed for in
 jaguar, by allowing 3D games. I wonder if VR head-
 sets will be the next leap....
 <P><B>TG:</B> Full color or monochromatic? I wonder as
 well.
 </P><P><B>JM:</B> We will see.  The jaguar headset we are working
 on with Virtuality should be a lot of fun.
 <P><B>TG:</B> One final question: at the end of your day, how
 does it make you feel to know that there are so
 many people around the world who enjoy your
 design - both users, and developers?
 </P><P><B>JM:</B> It's a good feeling.  Having been in this industry
 for 14 years, this is the first product I have designed
 to make it into six figure volumes. (And here's hop-
 ing for eight figures! (Tens of millions for the non-
 mathematical. But as I said earlier, the baby has left
 home, and my work on it is over. I think more about
 jaguars 2 and 3.
 <P><B>TG:</B> On behalf of my readers, I wish to thank you
 Mr. Mathieson, both for spending this time with us,
 and for all of the hard work you've put in on
 jaguar. We wish you and your creations the best!
