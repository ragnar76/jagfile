<P>The CD drive has an access
   time of 210 milliseconds, and has a sustained data transfer rate of 352.8K
   per second.  The CD-ROM drive features a modified data bus interface for
   access to the Tom and Jerry chips almost directly, allowing for a higher
   throughput rate on sound and graphics.  Storage on a disc is approximately
   790 megabytes (6,320 megabits).  The CD-ROM drive plugs into the Jaguar's
   cartridge slot.  A pass-through cartridge slot allows cartridges to be used
  with the CD-ROM attached.  Separate memory cartridges allow Jaguar CD
  games to be saved for later play.</P>

   <P>The Jaguar CD-ROM drive allows delivery of full-screen, full-motion video.
   The CinePak video decompression system has been licensed from SuperMac
   Technologies.  It is a 7K routine in the GPU and can be included in any
   CD-ROM software that needs it, allowing full-screen video at 24 frames per
   second.  Movie quality pictures can then be overlaid on the screen with
   computer generated graphics if the game demands it.  Time-Warner has
   licensed a library of film clips from its movies to Atari.</P>
 
   <P>The Jaguar CD-ROM has "<A HREF="vlm.htm">Virtual Light Machine</A>" built in.  This program plays
   audio CDs and generate accompanying color and visual effects that react to
   the music and sounds.  The user can control and select effects with the
   Jaguar controller.  Regular audio CD playback features (volume control,
   track programming, etc.) are also available.</P>
 
   <P>The Jaguar CD-ROM is also designed to interface with audio CD, Karaoke CD,
   and CD+Graphics.  Supplimental cartridges for Kodak PhotoCD and MPEG-1
   (Motion Picture Experts Group) compression are possible.</P>

   <P>The CD-ROM drive is being manufactured by Philips in the United States.
   Its dimensions are 6.5" x 10.5" x 3.5", and it weighs 1 pound, 10 ounces.</P>
