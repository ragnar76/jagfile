       <LI>  Freeze Swirlies:
            Go to effect 9-1 (or any other hold-down-B-button effect).
             Hold down B to make the swirlies appear. Release B & quickly
             press 1-1 (or any other non-B-button effect) before the
             swirlies disappear. Return to effect 9-1 (or any other B-
             button effect). Now the swirlies are in the state/size they
             were in when you left effect 9-1. Move the joypad around &
             notice the swirlies will stay without pressing B. They will
             stay frozen in the other B-button effects. To cancel the
             freeze, press B.
