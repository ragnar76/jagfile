<P>
<H2>Get 18 free points</H2>
<UL>Ok, here's how to get 18 free points in Troy Aikman Football.
<LI>1) Score a touchdown
<LI>2) Immediately press OPTION
<LI>3) Call a timeout
</UL>

<P ALIGN=justify>You get the 6 points for a touchdown, here the computer returns
you to the play screen.  Score another touchdown and get 6 more
points.  Score a third and get 6 more.
After the last touchdown, you kick the extra point.  You do not
kick 4 extra points, just 1.</P>

<P ALIGN=justify>Also, I think it only allows this 3 times in a game, not a half.
And I think that you start at the next down.
For example:  you score on second down.  You call a timeout, and
get 6 points.  It's now 3rd down from the 1 yard line.  You score
again and it's forth down from the 1 yard line.
It's best to score on first down for this reason.</P>

<P ALIGN=justify>Also, I just use play #3, C.  This is the fullback run over
the left tackle.  You can sprint over the end for 1 yard 99.9%
of the time.</P>
<HR noshade>
<H2>Score 2 extra touchdowns</H2>
    After you score a touchdown, press Option and call a time-out. 
    You get 6 points and the ball at the 1 yard line. Then
    repeat. You can score up to 3 touchdowns per down (18
    points).
