<P><B> Note:</B> Andrew Whittaker is a programmer with
 Rebellion Software (Alien vs.  Predator).</P>

 <P>The darkness of the metallic halls seemingly
 encroach further (as if that were physically possible), and your feelings of claustrophobia increase.
 Engine hissing and the distant screan-iing of aliens fill
 the corridors, giving yourself and all others present
 goosebumps.  Suddenly, you react to the surprise
 clawing attack of an Alien-its attack cry as it jumps
 out at you, making your heart skip as you let loose
 with both shotgun and invectives.</P>
      <P>To whom do we owe this genuinely
 Giegeresque experience?  Why, the people on the
 Alien, vs.  Predator development team at Rebellion
 and Atari of course.</P>
      <P>One of the key members of this team was
 Andrew Whittaker, whom I have recently had the
 pleasure of spending some time on the phone with.
 Much has happened to Andrew professionally since
 work on AvP initially began.</P>
      <P>Andrew got into the computer field working as
 a member of the Graftgold development team at
 Hossent Computers, then moved to the USB software company, then on to Commodore Computers
 doing hardware development.  Finally, he wound up
 at Rebellion.</P>
      <P>Andrew started at Rebellion as one of the two
 programmers forAvP and was responsible for all the
 artificial intelligence (which took six months alone
 to develop) and much of the 3D engine used in the
 game.  During the course of the project, Andrew left
 Rebellion in order to join the ranks of Atari's inhouse programming staff.</P>
     <P> In my conversation with Andrew, I learned several interesting tidbits that others might like to
 know about the development of AvP.</P>
      <P>There can be over 3500 creatures in the game.
      Before all of the objects and creatures were



 placed,the 3D engine was running at about 50-60
 frames per second.  Due to the tracking and AI of all
 of these creatures (not all at once mind you) the
 engine slowed down to its present pace.  Andrew
 was willing to sacrifice speed for more realistic (and
 devious) AI.</P>
     <P>Some people complained about the "cohabitation" of Aliens and Predators in the same room (or
 some other unbelievable combination).  Well,
 Andrew had the AI so realistic, that in the Marine
 scenario, the Predators went around the levels
 killing most of the Ahens until they themselves were
 killed by the Marine-thus making that game consid-
 erably more easy.</P>
     <P>The ever-present delays were due to the changing development systems.  Because they started
 development before the kits were finalized,
 Rebellion would receive a "revised" development
 system on almost a weekly basis.This forced them to
 backtrack and redo certain parts of their earlier
 code from time to time.</P>
