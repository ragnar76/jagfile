<P>Most often, the "red screen" problem appears after the Jaguar logo has
   disappeared off the TV screen, and is caused by one of the following:</P><P>
<OL> 
   <LI> Poor contact between the Jaguar and the cartridge (most likely).  Make
   sure that the cartridge is firmly seated in the cartridge slot, and that
   contacts are not dirty/dusty.
 
   <LI> Bent pins in the cartridge slot (rare).  This may be caused by rough
   edges on some cartridges.  The pins should be carefully straightened.
 
   <LI> Defective cartridge (rare).  If the red screen only appears with one
   cartridge but not others, the game may be defective.  Exchange it for
   another.
</OL> 
   <P>If the Jaguar logo appears without problems, then the Jaguar is probably
   working fine, and it's only the data transfer between the unit and the
   cartridge that's causing the problem.</P>
