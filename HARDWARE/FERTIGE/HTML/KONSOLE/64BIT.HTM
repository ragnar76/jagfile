<H1>Is the Jaguar really a 64-bit system?</H1>
<HR>
<P>The question is hard to resolve, largely because the definition of what
   constitutes an "N-bit" system has not been set.  Of the five processors in
   the Jaguar, only the object processor and the blitter are "true" 64-bit
   components.  Because the blitter and the object processor are in the Tom
   chip, by extension Tom is a 64-bit chip.  The Jaguar also uses a 64-bit
   memory architecture, according to Jez San of Argonaut Software.</P>

   <P>Some say the Jaguar should be considered a 32-bit system, as that is the
   maximum register size in the programmable processors (the 68000, the
   graphics processor, and the DMA sound processor).  Others say the Jaguar
   can be considered a 64-bit system, because 64-bit components are used, and
   the GPU can access 64 bits of data if required.  Again, the lack of an
   agreed-upon definition serves to complicate the issue.</P>

   <P>According to Jaguar designer John Mathieson, <I>"Jaguar has a 64-bit memory
   interface to get a high bandwidth out of cheap DRAM. ... Where the system
   needs to be 64 bit then it is 64 bit, so the Object Processor, which takes
   data from DRAM and builds the display is 64 bit; and the blitter, which
   does all the 3D rendering, screen clearing, and pixel shuffling, is 64 bit.
   Where the system does not need to be 64 bit, it isn't.  There is no point
   in a 64 bit address space in a games console!  3D calculations and audio
   processing do not generally use 64-bit numbers, so there would be no
   advantage to 64 bit processors for this."</I></P>

   <P><I>"Jaguar has the data shifting power of a 64 bit system, which is what
   matters for games, so can reasonably be considered a 64 bit system.  But
   that doesn't mean it has to be 64 bits throughout."</I></P>

   <P>For the record, the opinion of most third party developers and observers
   is that the Jaguar is indeed a 64-bit system.  The emphasis is on the word
   "system"; while not every component is 64 bits, the Jaguar architecture, as
   a COMPLETE SYSTEM, is.</P>
