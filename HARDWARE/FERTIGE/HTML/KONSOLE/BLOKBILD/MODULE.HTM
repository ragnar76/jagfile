<HR>
<P>Game cartridges can support up to six
   megabytes (48 megabits) of information, and can contain an EEPROM
   (electrically erasable/programmable read-only memory) chip to save game
   information and settings.  <BR>
Up to 100,000 writes can be performed with the
   EEPROM; after that, future writes may not be saved (performance varies
   widely, but 100,000 is a guaranteed minimum).  Depending on use, this limit
   should take from 10 to 50 years to reach.</P>
