<H1>IBM and Jaguar</H1>
<HR>
<P>IBM had a $500 million contract with Atari Corp. to assemble, test,
   package, and distribute Jaguar units.  Manufacturing was done at IBM's
   Charlotte, NC facility, and the Jaguar was IBM's first attempt at producing
   a consumer grade product for an outside vendor.  Specifically, Jaguar
   circuit boards were manufactured and assembled by an IBM subcontractor;
   IBM cases, tests, and packages final Jaguar units; units were then sent to
   Atari for distribution.</P>

   <P>IBM had no known participation in the design of the Jaguar.  IBM had no
   plans to create games for the Jaguar.</P>

   <P>Jaguar units were also manufactured by Comptronix in
   Colorado Springs.</P>
