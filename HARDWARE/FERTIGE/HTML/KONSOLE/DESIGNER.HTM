<H1>Jaguar Designer</H1>
<HR>
<P>The primary designers of the Jaguar are Martin Brennan and <A HREF="mathison.htm">John Mathieson</A>.
   They started their own company in 1986 called Flare 1, and designed an
   original multiprocessor game console.  After the system was finished, Flare
   wanted to "evolve" the system, but needed funding for the job.  Atari was
   contacted, believed in the idea, and agreed to participate.  Atari,
   Brennan, and Mathieson started a new company called Flare 2 to develop the
   system. As Jaguar development moved along, it became apparent that the
   machine would leapfrog the new systems from Nintendo and Sega, so they
   decided to bring the machine to light.  The entire process took three
   years, from initial design to production-ready models.</P>

   <P>The proprietary chips are manufactured by Toshiba and Motorola.</P>
