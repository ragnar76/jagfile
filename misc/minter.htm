INTERVIEW BY: Tal Funke-Bilu
(Atari Explorer Online, Issue #6, April 1994)
<HR NOSHADE>
 <FONT COLOR="NAVY"><P><B>Tal:</B> Jeff, I first read your columss in STAction about
 6 or 7 years ago... was the ST your first Atari love or
 were you a 2600 man? (Or should I say "a 2600
 Yak"?)</P>

 <FONT COLOR="BLACK"><P><B>Jeff:</B> When I was at University I blew quite a bit of
 one term's grant on a VCS.  Late nights playing Space
 Invaders and Superman... got my Dad into games
 with that VCS: I brought it home one holiday and
 had it set up on the TV with Space Invaders, when
 my dad came home, I offered him a go and got the
 usual bollocks about 'I can't do those, I'm too old'...
 I insisted he have a go and I didn't get a look at the
 joystick for a couple of hours.  My dad now has a
 Snes, a PC-Engine CD-ROM, a Lynx, a Genesis, a
 Gameboy, an Atari ST, an Amiga, a Vectrex, a
 Colecovision from way back, likewise an
 Intellivision, and he'll have a jag as soon as I can get
 him one, and he plays at least three hours of games
 a day.. but I digress.<P>
      The VCS was my first console, but for a long
 time all the programming I was doing was on
 Commodore kit - from my first P-50 programmable
 calculator, then the PET then the Vic-20 and to the
 C64, it was Commodore all the way.  Then I switched
 to the Atari ST then the TT, the Falcon, and finally the
 Jaguar.  So I guess you'd have to say that my first
 games love was Atari, but for programming it was
 Commodore, and remained so until the Tramiels left.</P>



<FONT COLOR="NAVY"><P><B>Tal:</B> How did the Yak get his start in programming?
When did you first STart programming the ST?</P>



 <FONT COLOR="BLACK"><P><B>Jeff:</B> Well, I started by writing games for my fellow students
 at college, on the 8K PET they had, the old one
 with the little keyboard and the built-in tape drive.
 You were allowed half an hour access a day, which I'd spend frantically 
  typing in hex pairs, execute, and
  then trying to find out where it crashed... I got quite
  good at doing jump offsets in hex in my head. I actually
  used to get up early (an unheard-of thing) and
  stay late to get more time.  Never sold any of the
  games I made, but it was good practise having the
  games played by a bunch of critical mates - you pretty soon
 learned about playability, if a game sucked
  no-one would play it!  After college I went to univer-
  sity where I spent a year playing about on the col-
  lege mainframe and also on the obligatory ZX80, and
  definitely not much maths and physics, which is
  what I was supposed to be doing; consequently I
  was ejected after a year.  Still figuring I ought to do
  the "right" thing, I got a place on a polytechnic
  course (still maths and physics, but with the option
  to switch to computing in the second year).
  However, three months in I copped a pretty nasty
  virus and was ill for three or four months, so I had
  to drop out of the course.<P>
      By then I had a Vic 20 and while I was in, I
  coded a fairly crude Defender game called "Andes
  Attack", in which you had to protect llamas instead
  of humanoids.  At some point we decided to try to
  sell the game, and under the name Llamasoft we
  went to a Commodore computer show in London.
  We took a TV and my Vic and loaded up the game
  and let people play.  We were surprised when we
  sold out of games on the first day.. then this guy
  from a LJS outfit called Human Engineered Software
  came by and asked me if I could do a ROM version
  for them to sell in the States.  That was the break
  which really got Llamasoft started. I wrote a game
  for HES called Gridrunner which did pretty well and
  we copped for a lot of royalties.<P>
      I got into the ST right when it first came out.At
  that time, I'd been coding the C64 for a few years,
  and then the Amiga and ST both came out, and they
  both looked pretty interesting.  Commodore, however, 
 had a shitty attitude towards game programmers
  at the time; they wanted the Amiga to be perceived as a 
 business machine, so game programmers didn't
 get invited to the previews, and it just didn't feel like
 they wanted to help us get our hands on the new
 wonder-machine. Atari, however, were most co-oper-
 ative, and I had one of the first 30 machines to arrive
 in Europe.</P>



 <FONT COLOR="NAVY"><P><B>Tal:</B> At the time, what was the most inviting aspect of
programming on the ST.- what put it ahead of the
competition?</P>



 <FONT COLOR="BLACK"><P><B>Jeff:</B> Obviously, the speed was part of it, also proper
 colour pixel- accessible graphics - characters and
 sprites are OK but they do constrain you. I had start-
 ed to work on the light synthesiser idea on the C64,
 and the prospect of a good colour bitmapped display
 and a mouse for input to the lightsynth was irre-
 sistable.  The first ST program I wrote was
 "Colourspace".  As for being ahead of the competi-
 tion, well, at the time the Amiga was really over-
 priced - well over a grand, I remeber - so the ST out-
 sold it massively.  I also found that in my experience
 TOS/GEM just felt more solid than early
 AmigaDOS/Workbench.  Too many Guru Meditations
 for my liking.</P>



<FONT COLOR="NAVY"><P><B>Tal:</B> In your ST Action columns you often bragged
 about your various Lynx high-scores or accomplishments .... 
 Have you ever been tempted to sit down
 and develop for the Lynx?  Is it a possibility in the
 future?</P>



 <FONT COLOR="BLACK"><P><B>Jeff:</B> At the time it came out I would have killed to write
 Lynx games.  However Liamasoft wasn't a big enough
 company to sustain the cost of developing and pub-
 lishing out own games on ROM, and I didn't know of
 any larger companies who would let me do the kind
 of games I wanted to do - so I carried on with the ST.
 As for now, I guess Atari want me chained to a jag for
 a while - and I can't say I'm complaining.</P>



 <FONT COLOR="NAVY"><P><B>Tal:</B> How do you feel about the state of video games
 today? 10 years ago there weren't flashy graphics or
 sound, just downright good gameplay.  Where do you
 think we are going with all the FMV and stereo



    sound?  Can a bad game cover up its flaws with
    flashy graphics and sound?  Elaborate. (Easy for me
    to say.)</P>

    <FONT COLOR="BLACK"><P><B>Jeff:</B> Well, I think that we're about to see a repeat of
    the old "laser game" syndrome with the current
    obsession with FMV Remember back in the mid-
    Eighties when everyone was predicting the demise
    of traditional coin-ops in favour of the all-new "Laser
    Games" based on Videodisc technology?  Sure, the
    first tirne you saw one, it def@tely made you go
    44 wow" to see real video in a game.Then you played
    the games and found out that they were either tra-
    ditional games superimposed over a noninteractive
    background, or else they were simple affairs where
    you'd make a series of decisions interspersed with
    noninteractive video clips.  You soon got bored; the
    laser-game era quietly passed away.The key word in
    this context is "noninteractive".<P>
       Laserdisc and FMV alike are exzellent media for
    watching films, just like a VCR.  However, the nature
    of games is the interactivity - the creation of a little
    world within which you can do whatever you like,
    constrained only by the rules of gameplay.  Laserdisc,
    FMV and your VCR are exzellent at linear playback
    of pre-recorded scenes - but the only degree of free-
    dom you have is to say where playback starts or
    ends.  Sure, you can have different sections of video
    present themselves according to certain player
    action, but you're never going to be able to show
    every possible view for every possible player action
    even with the storage capacity of CD.  Since you
    can't show all the views, the only option is to constrain the player's actions.<P>
      That is not to say that CD as a medium for
    games is bad - far from it.The true advantage of CD
    is the immense data storage capacity.  By using a 
system like the Jaguar - capable of rendering detailed
    3D worlds which are fully interactive - with the 
CDROM to hold details of levels, graphics of enemies,
    loads of tunes etc. , etc. (and maybe a couple of 
unintrusive FMV for breaks in the gameplay, scene-setting 
etc.), it will be possible to design games with
    incredible depth and detail, the like of which would
    never be possible on a ROM.<P>
     Games like this are the future, definitely not the
    constrained stringing-together-of-film-clips type
    stuff you currently see so much of on the Sega CD and 3D0.  
In a way I think that it's good that the jag
 <I>doesn't</I> have a CD-ROM drive straight away, as
 developers have to concentrate on getting the most
 out of the jag's hardware instead of going down the
 route of "let's make a pretty game by spooling lots of
 pre-rendered images off the CD-ROM, at least the
 screen pictures will look good in the magazines." By
 the time jag CD comes out, developers will already
 know the power they've got in the Jaguar, and hopefully
won't want to waste that power by using it to
 emulate a VCR.<P>
     As for covering up bad gameplay with great
 graphics and sound, yes, it goes on all the time. 1
 think a lot of the reason people say "the old games
 are the best" is that Way Back When, you had very
 limited resources to play with in terms of RAM,
 colours onscreen, processor power, etc. lf you wanted
 someone to get addicted to your game you had
 to put everything into the playability.  Games such as
 Defender, Asteroids, Missile Command and Tempest
 were not very large, but by Ghod they were nigh-on
 perfectly balanced.The learning curve was perfect,
 dedicated players could get really skillful, beginners
 weren't too intimidated, there were no great discontinuities
 in the gameplay.. now, it seems that a
 lot of games just take an off-the-shelf gameplay
 basis, like vertical-scroller, platform game, yet-anoth-
 er-Rtype clone, etc., and dress it up with great graph-
 ics and sound.  I have a friend who works at Sega and
 I went round to see him once and he showed me a
 lot of new Genesis stuff, and by the time I saw the
 ninth R-Type, I was begging him to stop... in a lot of
 games on current 16 bit systems players have <I>less</I>
 control than they did in, say, Defender or Asteroids.
 Game design seems almost to have become a forgotten art.<P>
      I think, and hope, that is going to change with
 the introduction of high-powered systems like the
 Jag.  Now that we have the power to create fully-
 interactive 3D game scenarios, players will demand
 more interaction; game designers are no longer constrained 
by limitations of the hardware.  Some people will just
 port the old formulas to the new environment - 
Star Fox is only R-Type in 3D, you can't
 actually fly anywhere you like.  That's unlike
 Cybermorph, which gives you a world and a craft to
 make your way around it and leaves the rest up to
 you.  At last game design is becoming important again.
That's not to say that in a year's time we will
not be seeing "yet-another-DOOM" or "yet-another-
polygon-world",'coz there will always be those who
see a successful game and clone it to the max; but I
think that there will also always be some people
who want to do something entirely different.</P>



 <FONT COLOR="NAVY"><P><B>Tal:</B> You are well known for your EXCELLENT adapta-
 tion of Tempest for the Jaguar in the form of
 Tempest 2000.When did you first hear about the Jag
 and what convinced you that it would be worth
 developing on?</P>

 <FONT COLOR="BLACK"><P><B>Jeff:</B> I got invited to a Jag devcon in the UK at the end
 of '92, where we were shown Jag for the first time.
 They had Tigercube (which has since mutated to
 become the spirining Jaguar logo) and various
 demos of the colour capabilities, spriting and
 Gouraud shading. I was interested then, and they
 gave us the tech notes to take away and they made
 interesting reading, but I didn't fully realise what Jag
 was actually like until a few weeks later.Atari invited
 me out to Sunnyvale to write some demos for the
 Jag.  I remember the moment the penny dropped - I
 was learning the blitter and I wrote this warp effect
 using only the 68K and the blitter. I assumed that, as
 it was quite a nasty warp, it would be a non-realtime
 effect - something you'd do once to a bitmap and
 then display the result.  I got it going, it ran, and
 warped this image of a girlie I was using as source.
 Then Leonard came by and said, how about putting
 it in a realtime loop?  I said naaah, didn't intend it to
 be realtime, but I put it in a loop that altered some
 parameters and tried it out anyway.. and it went in
 realtime - that girlie was warping about like she was
 on a sheet of rubber, and I just went F###!  Then it
 just took over, the hardware sprite scaling, the rota-
 tion, the shaded blitting, it just blew me away again
 and again. At that point my soul belonged to Jaguar.</P>



<FONT COLOR="NAVY"><P><B>Tal:</B> Let's be up front about this I'm sure a lot of peo-
 ple would like it if you completed the following sen-
 tence and elaborated on the subject: "Programming
 on the Jag is soooo bloody fun because</P>

 <FONT COLOR="BLACK"><P><B>Jeff:</B> you can politely ask the processors to do a 
billion insane things, and they'll do them and still have
 time left over to make you a cup of tea, do the laundry, nip down the shops and tidy the house, before
 the next frame interrupt.</P>



 <FONT COLOR="NAVY"><P><B>Tal:</B> A lot of people want a cart or CD packed with a
 bunch of old classics ... Defender, Phoenix, etc ....  Are
 you going to be the man to bring those to life on the
 Jag?  We know joust is rumored to be an Easter egg
 in an upcoming release... are we going to see more
 old games hidden this way?</P>



<FONT COLOR="BLACK"><P><B>Jeff:</B> Depends on the individual developers I suppose.
 Nice idea, if yo have the spare memory and time in
 the schedule to fit them in.</P>


 <FONT COLOR="NAVY"><P><B>Tal:</B> OK Jeff, what game are you most looking forward
 to on the Jag?</P>

<FONT COLOR="BLACK"><P><B>Jeff:</B> Provided they can capture the essence of the
 original and transfer it to 64-bit, definitely "Star
 Raiders".</P>


<FONT COLOR="NAVY"><P><B>Tal:</B> What do you think of the statement "The Jag has
 the power to redefine video games..." ?</P>

<FONT COLOR="BLACK"><P><B>Jeff:</B> I think that could be true.. if a bit advertising-
 hypey.. the Jag is particularly exciting as it's the first
 console platform to offer gaming satisfaction to two
 previously separate segments of the market - the
 Nintendo/Sega area, where the emphasis is on
 cutesy, sprite- based scrolly games, and the high-end
 gamer who until now has bought a fast 486 with CD-
 ROM etc. to play polygon-based simulations and
 more complex strategic games.The Jag can do better
 scrolly/spritey games than the current 16-bitters, and
 we all know how good it is at doing fast polygons....
 Consequently, people who might turn their noses up
 at Sega/Nintendo, who have a reputation for serving
 the 14+-year-old market, may well buy a Jag,'coz it's
 a lot cheaper than a top-end 486... so in this respect
 I can see Jag redefining the console market.</P>



 <FONT COLOR="NAVY"><P><B>Tal:</B> What's the story with Mollie and Flossie?</P>

 <FONT COLOR="BLACK"><P><B>Jeff:</B> Molly and Flossie are my two pet sheep.  Molly is
 bigger than Flossie, but Flossie is better-looking.
 They both like a digestive biscuit first thing in the
 morning, and bleat piteously outside the door if I
 don't give.  Flossie is the most friendly, she comes
 running over for a scratch in the fleece every time 1
 step outside.  Have you heard the sheep bleating in
 T2K?</P>


 <FONT COLOR="NAVY"><P><B>Tal:</B> Are they Molly and Flossie?</P>

 <FONT COLOR="BLACK"><P><B>Jeff:</B> Sadly they're not.  Imagitec obviously 
have me correctly pegged as an ovophile and stuck some sheep
 bleating samples in the tune which accompanies
 the Bacon.  You never get to hear them in normal
 gameplay, as the bonus level completes before the
 tune wraps, but if you pause and press "A" for music
 volume adjust, you can hear it all the way through.
 Needless to say I was well tickled by it when I first
 heard the tunes!</P>


<FONT COLOR="NAVY"><P><B>Tal:</B> Your personal best on Tempest?</P>

<FONT COLOR="BLACK"><P><B>Jeff:</B> While I was out at Atari, level 97, just over two
 million.  Haven't played daily recently as my Jag is
 running lightsynth all the time and its a hassle loading 
it into the Romulator each time I want to play -
 I still don't have a Tempest 2000 cartridge.</P>


<FONT COLOR="NAVY"><P><B>Tal:</B> Do you feel the joypad lives up to the paddles of
 the arcade classic?</P>

<FONT COLOR="BLACK"><P><B>Jeff:</B> As well as it ever could.  Nothing beats the 
original flywheel control, but I think I got about as close
 as I could get with a joypad, to giving you the same
 amount of control.  It takes a little while to get used
 to the way it accelerates and the orientation with
 respect to circular webs, but it soon becomes
 instinctive.</P>

<FONT COLOR="NAVY"><P><B>Tal:</B> Most annoying bug pointed out by the Tempest
 Beta-Testing team?</P>

 <FONT COLOR="BLACK"><P><B>Jeff:</B> Definitely all the little bastardy glitches I had with
 the sounds. You'd fix one, up comes another one.  Oh
 yeah, and the dreaded "locked-Pause" fatal I was
 <I>sure</I> I'd nailed about six times .... ;-)</P>



 <FONT COLOR="NAVY"><P><B>Tal:</B> Ever make it through Beastly Mode?  Know 
anyone who has? :)</P>

 <FONT COLOR="BLACK"><P><B>Jeff:</B> Nope; Level 97's me best.  Hank at Atari Test got
 there the day after I left.  You're the only other guy
 I've heard of doing it, and I've certainly not heard of
 anyone going double-Beastly. I honestly believe that
 next time Atari Test are looking for a demon thumb
 they should get in touch with you  ... double-Beasty in
 two weeks, that's going some.</P>



<FONT COLOR="NAVY"><P><B>Tal:</B> What does the Yak eat while he's coding?</P>

 <FONT COLOR="BLACK"><P><B>Jeff:</B> Junkfood normally; I am largely fuelled by lakes of
 tea.  I like liver pate sandwiches for a snack, once a
 day I cook something, inasmuch as the verb "to
 cook" can be applied to "getting something out the
 freezer, putting it in the microwave, pressing the
 button and waiting for it to go" ding". Which is not
 to say that I dislike good food; just that, living alone
 I can rarely be asked to make it for myself.  If it takes
 longer to cook than it does to eat I don't bother...
</P>


<FONT COLOR="NAVY"><P><B>Tal:</B> What is your favorite type of tea?</P>

<FONT COLOR="BLACK"><P><B>Jeff:</B> Good, honest PG Tips.  As the ad campaign says,
 "There's no other tea to beat PG!" <g></P>



 <FONT COLOR="NAVY"><P><B>Tal:</B> Your favorite Pink Floyd album? Are you going
 to try and catch their world tour?</P>

<FONT COLOR="BLACK"><P><B>Jeff:</B> Ummm difficult, I find that my favourite Floyd
 varies to suit my current state of mind, but I guess
 overall probably Wish You Were Here, although I do
 like "Meddle" very much (especially Echoes) and the
 Wall when I'm feeling alienated</P>



 <FONT COLOR="NAVY"><P><B>Tal:</B> Your all-time favorite video game (any platform?)</P>

 <FONT COLOR="BLACK"><P><B>Jeff:</B> <thinks> ummm StarRaidersDefenderStarRaiders
 Defender ..
     Star Raiders.  It's the only game I've ever had
 quite that feeling of just joy at waking up in the
 morning and knowing I could play..</P>



 <FONT COLOR="NAVY"><P><B>Tal:</B> Lets wrap things up with a discussion on your
 future with the Jag.  What is the scoop on your CD-lightshow? (Is that a proper name for it?) Where do
 you plan to go after that?  What games are in the Jeff
 Minter coding line-up?  Any last minute comments
 (the entire Atari community is waiting ... )?</P>

 <FONT COLOR="BLACK"><P><B>Jeff:</B> The lightsynth is called the Virtual Light Machine.
 I've been working on lightsynth stuff since 1984 on
 various platforms. the Jag CD-ROM lightsynth draws
 on that past expierence, using the best algorithms
 from those earlier generations and applying Jag spe-
 cialities to them, like shaded poly drawing and digi-
 tal feedback ("Melt-o-Vision", as Atari call it).
 Parameters governing pattern Generation may be
 controlled by oscillators, modified by an audio spec-
 trum analyser to produce patterns which respond to
 the music from CD, and altered by the "player", or
 any combination of the three, effectively allowing
 you to "jam" in graphics along to your favourite
 music.<P>
     VLM is not a Llamasoft project; a few years ago
 I teamed up with a couple of other guys who were
 also interested in the lightsynth idea, and we formed
 the Virtual Light Company to develop our ideas (and
 we formed the Co. a year and a half before Gibson's
 latest book came out, BTW).  The VLM is a VLC-devel-
 oped program; I'm doing the graphics and the very
 exzellent Dr. Ian Bennett is doing the audio frequency
 analysis, as his Maths is better than mine!</P>
<P>
     After the VLM, Atari have asked me to get
 involved in a team who are doing a CD-ROM game,
 which I can't spill any beans about yet but which
 should be really excellent, from the scenarios I've
 read.  And no, it's not going to be simulating a VCR.
 After that I'd like to do another complete game
 myself, I have yet to talk to John at Atari about what,
 I know I'd kill to do to Defender what I did to
 Tempest, or else do Super Llamatron... hey if Sega can
 have a flipping hedgehog why can't Atari have a
Ilama, especially a laser-spitting take-no-prisoners
bad-ass rock hard llama? <g>
</P>


<FONT COLOR="NAVY"><P><B>Tal:</B> Thank you for your time I wish you all
 the success in the world with your upcoming endeavors
 if they are half as good as Tempest, I'm sure we'1I all
 be pleased!
</P>
 <FONT COLOR="BLACK"><P><B>Jeff:</B> No problem I'll do me best I just hope I can
 follow Tempest!</P>
